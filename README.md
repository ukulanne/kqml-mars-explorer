KQML Mars Explorer

 Originally developed for Dr Scheme < http://plt-scheme.org/software/drscheme/ >
 It can be run on Dr Racket < https://racket-lang.org/ > with Language set to Pretty Big.
 I found this code on an backup hard drive. I wrote this for a Computer Vision class.

 Run with:
;; With rovers and messages
;;(main 4000 #t 'kqml-rover)

;; With kqml messages but no rovers
;;(main 4000 #t 'kqml)

;; No interaction between them Everything on your own
;;(main 4000 #t #f)
