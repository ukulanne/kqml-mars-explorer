KQML Mars Explorer

 Originally developed for [Dr Scheme](http://plt-scheme.org/software/drscheme/)
 It can be run on [Dr Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) with Language set to Pretty Big.
 I found this code that I wrote for a Computer Vision class some time ago.

Run with:
* With rovers and messages `(main 4000 #t 'kqml-rover)`
* With kqml messages but no rovers `(main 4000 #t 'kqml)`
* No interaction between them Everything on your own `(main 4000 #t #f)`


#  #What is KQML?
_KQML or the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language is a language and protocol for exchanging information and knowledge. It is part of a larger effort, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort which is aimed at developing techniques and methodology for building large-scale knowledge bases which are sharable and reusable. KQML is both a message format and a message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge sharing among agents. KQML can be used as a language for an application program to interact with an intelligent system or for two or more intelligent systems to share knowledge in support of cooperative problem solving.
KQML focuses on an extensible set of performatives, which defines the permissible operations that agents may attempt on each other's knowledge and goal stores. The performatives comprise a substrate on which to develop higher-level models of inter-agent interaction such as contract nets and negotiation. In addition, KQML provides a basic architecture for knowledge sharing through a special class of agent called communication facilitators which coordinate the interactions of other agents The ideas which underlie the evolving design of KQML are currently being explored through experimental prototype systems which are being used to support several testbeds in such areas as concurrent engineering, intelligent design and intelligent planning and scheduling.
